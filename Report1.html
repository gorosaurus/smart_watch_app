     <dt><h3>Samuel Messinger 	    (7006182) (samuelmessinger@yahoo.com)</h3></dt>
        <dd>
        Sam has proficient knowledge of HTML and CSS, as a result of a few years of practice and study at university.
        He is confident in his ability to code in either Java or C, and mostly confident with C#. He does not have knowledge 
        of SVG or the &lt;canvas&gt; element, and only limited knowledge with working with JavaScript. 
        Sam is more of a follower rather than a leader, and can be dedicated to a job when set on it. 
        He is good at proof-reading and editing of work such as reports, but not as good as writing them in the first place.
        </dd>
     <dt><h3>Finnegan Miles-Hussey (5453391) (fmileshussey@outlook.com)</h3></dt>
        <dd> 
        Finnegan is confident working with Java &amp; C. He has working knowledge of HTML5 &amp; CSS. 
        He has little to no knowledge of JavaScript, SVG &amp; the &lt;canvas&gt; element. Confident with writing and proofreading 
        skills which can be used when writing the report.

     <dt><h3>Robert Young          (3176240) (robertyoung10101@gmail.com)</h3></dt>
        <dd>
        Robert knows enough HTML/CSS to make a basic website and is familiar with Javascript. 
        He has working knowledge in C and Java along with some basic ability in C++ and Perl. 
        He doesn't know any JQuery, SVG or &lt;canvas&gt; at the moment, but he's currently learning them. 
        He has some experience with Visual Basic for Applications as well.
        </dd>
    <dt><h3>Yasmin Saleem          (7357697) (salya080@student.otago.ac.nz)</h3></dt>
        <dd> Yasmin has enough knowledge of html5 , css, php, jquery and javascript to build a web application.<br>
        She also has a good knowledge of Java, fine knowledge of C and a relatively ok knowledge of C++ but not enough to write big complicated programs.
        <br>She started coding just a year and a half ago so she does not have any working experience in any of the mentioned languages apart from studying.
        <br>Yasmin is good at organising group meetings and managing the flow of work.</dd>

    <h2>Description of App</h2>
        <p>
            With such a small screen, reading on a smartwatch the conventional way could be difficult. 
            By printing one word to the screen at a time in quick succession, our application would implement Rapid Serial Visual
            Representation, an alternative method of reading that would be ideal for the small screen of a smartwatch.
            RSVR implementations such as Spritz and Spreeder have been created before, but, to our group’s knowledge,
            one hasn’t been created for the smartwatch. Our application would access text files from the smartwatch’s file system
            and present them to the user with easily customisable speeds and fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
            What makes our application good for our group is that it is easily scalable, significantly 
            decreasing our risk of failure. It could start out by interpreting .txt files before moving on to pdf, 
            docx, and epub files along with other ebook formats. Ideally, we hope to eventually give our 
            app HTML-reading capabilities, opening up the possibility of creating a primitive browser for the smartwatch. 
        </p>

            Here is a diagram representing the partitioning of work between the emulator and application:

    <h2>Version Control System</h2>
    <p>
        We chose to use GitHub over other means of version control for a number of reasons.
GitHub offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management functionality of Git, 
as well as adding it's own features.</p>

<p>
    It provides the ability to revert documents to previous revisions, 
providing an important system of back-ups and the ability to fork projects. <br>Forking can be done in one-click, 
which makes it easy to work on another version of the project at no risk of overwriting what is already in place. 
GitHub is also a free service, which means that no extra funds had to be spent on the project, and accessibility is high. 
</p>

    <h2>Programming Language</h2>
    <p>Javascript is an interpreted language, meaning that it is a programming language that most of its implementations execute instructions directly without previously compiling the program into machine code language.
It is a dynamic programming language that execute many common programming behaviours that static programming languages perform during compilation at run time .
 Javascript is an untyped language. That means that it allows any operation to be performed on any data, which are generally considered to be sequences of bits of various lengths.
When saying JavaScript is dynamically typed; it means that a type is associated with each value, rather than just with each expression. For example, a variable that is at one time bound to a number may later be re-bound to a string. JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of an object.
Javascript can perform both as a procedural and an object oriented language. Objects are created in javascript by attaching method and properties to other empty objects at run time, and once the object is constructed it can be used as prototype for creating similar objects.
It is an object oriented language with first-class functions, which means that it treats functions as first class citizen. It supports passing functions as arguments to other functions, returning them as values from other functions and assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures.
It is a prototype- based scripting language. It builds up object systems by inheritances and aggregation. Inheritance is done by copying existing objects ( prototypes).
According to Douglas Crockford ( an American senior JavaScript architect at PayPal, and is also a writer and speaker on JavaScript, JSON, and related web technologies) inheritance of prototypes in JavaScript is described as “: you make prototype objects, and then … make new instances. Objects are mutable in JavaScript, so we can augment the new instances, giving them new fields and methods. These can then act as prototypes for even newer objects. We don't need classes to make lots of similar objects… Objects inherit from objects. What could be more object oriented than that?”
Javascripts works within the web browser, it cannot handle aggregating information from users and communicating them with other machines. It does not contact the server, thus cannot store information on the server.
JavaScript does not perform server side validation, only clients side validation.
Javascript works differently in different browsers.

    <h2>The Editor</h2>
        <p>
            The team has chosen to use NetBeans, which is an open source code editor. We decided to use NetBeans as, first of all, it is able to run on both windows and OSX, which were necessary for our group. NetBeans also provides functionality such as syntax highlighting, code analysis and code completion, which is very easy to use, and features drag-and-drop functionality for quickly creating GUI's, which was an extra bonus.
            NetBeans also features database support, including built-in functionality for SQL and Oracle. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This editor also has a built in debugger, which allows you to inspect your code step-by-step to see where any issues are occurring. NetBeans also has additional support for JavaScript, the language we will be coding in, with it's integrated JavaScript editor.
            Finally, NetBeans also has direct support for working with GitHub, making it much easier for the team to push/pull the project when needed. When any important change is made, we will be able to ‘push’ the project to the repository and instantly have a working backup.
        </p>

    <h2>The Debugger</h2>
    <p>Ultimately, we have decided to use the built-in debugger which comes with NetBeans. 
    There were many positives to using this debugger, including that we would not have to copy or paste code between two different programs. 
    We considered using a debugger in our browser, but instead decided that everything can just be done within NetBeans, 
    which significantly reduces complexity. It also features the use of breakpoints, allowing a user to ‘step through’ 
    their program line-by-line.
    </p>
    <p>Furthermore, NetBeans also contains a visual debugger, which allows for easier debugging on the GUI elements. 
    We will be able to take a GUI snapshot, and then locate any problem code from a visual standpoint. 
    This will be significantly quicker than searching through the code itself, as working with GUI code can be challenging.</p>

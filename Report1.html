     Robert knows enough HTML/CSS to make a basic website and is familiar with Javascript. He has working knowledge in C and Java along with some basic ability in C++ and Perl. He doesn't know any JQuery, SVG or <canvas> at the moment, but he's currently learning them.
    
    <h2>Description of App</h2>
        <p>
            With such a small screen, reading on a smartwatch the conventional way could be difficult. By printing one word to the screen at a time in quick succession, our application would implement Rapid Serial Visual Representation, an alternative method of reading that would be ideal for the small screen of a smartwatch. RSVR implementations such as Spritz and Spreeder have been created before, but, to our group’s knowledge, one hasn’t been created for the smartwatch. Our application would access text files from the smartwatch’s file system and present them to the user with easily customisable speeds and fonts.
            What makes our application good for our group is that it is easily scalable, significantly decreasing our risk of failure. It could start out by interpreting .txt files before moving on to pdf, docx, and epub files along with other ebook formats. Ideally, we hope to eventually give our app HTML-reading capabilities, opening up the possibility of creating a primitive browser for the smartwatch.
